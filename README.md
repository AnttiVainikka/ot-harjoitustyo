# **Dungeon Crawler**

## About

### Premise
Choose your team and venture a deadly labyrinth filled with monsters. Find the boss and defeat it to beat the game.

### Guide
Use the arrowkeys to move while exploring and use the numpad to give commands during battle. Currently, only the attack and skill commands work. To return from the skill selection scene, press r. All characters are automatically leveled to their max level so there should be no trouble defeating all the monsters.
